## Prerequisites

For Nolu to work properly and the install process to run smoothly it is important that you have the following stuff up and running:

1. Home Assistant in `Advanced Mode`
2. The following add-on's are installed through the add-on Store:
   - [Samba Share](https://github.com/home-assistant/addons/blob/master/samba/DOCS.md)
   - [SSH & Web Terminal (Home Assistant Community Add-on)](https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-ssh)
   - [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-vscode) or [File Explorer](https://github.com/home-assistant/addons/tree/master/configurator)
   - [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/docs/installation/installation/)
3. Next up, you need to install the following HACS integrations:
   - [browser_mod](https://github.com/thomasloven/hass-browser_mod)
   - [lovelace_gen](https://github.com/thomasloven/hass-lovelace_gen)
4. After this its time to install the HACS Frontend repositories:
   - [button-card](https://github.com/custom-cards/button-card)
   - [hui-element](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-hui-element)
   - [kiosk mode](https://github.com/maykar/kiosk-mode)
   - [layout-card](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-layout-card)
   - [light entity card](https://github.com/ljmerza/light-entity-card)
   - [mini-graph-card](https://github.com/kalkih/mini-graph-card)
   - [mini-media-player](https://github.com/kalkih/mini-media-player)
   - [simple weather card](https://github.com/kalkih/simple-weather-card)
5. Now may be a good time to do a restart of your HASS
6. When all is booted up, check `configuration` > `Lovelace Dashboards` > `Resources (tab)` and make sure all HACS Frontend resources are present

## Installation instructions

1. Now download Nolu's source from Github or clone the Nolu repository locally
2. Find the `nolu`-directory insided Nolu's source and copy it to the root of the `config`-directory of your Hass server
3.  From Nolu's source copy the contents of `configuration_example.yaml` and paste it in your own `configuration.yaml` (or use the parts you need if you know what you're doing). The `# Nolu - mandatory` rules are the ones that really need to be part of the `homeassistant:` definition, otherwise `Nolu` will not be able to start properly.
4. If you aren't using a `secrets.yaml` yet, know is the time to start using one! Rename the `secrets.sample.yaml` to `secrets.yaml` and add your privacy sensitive variables. Most of these variables are not used for the core part of `Nolu`, only the `hass_` variables are.
5. Open the custom config located at `nolu/custom_example/custom.config.yaml` and use this file to build your dashboard (for more information over what is possible check below 'Creating a custom dashboard')

ðŸŽ‰ You survived the most difficult part ðŸŽ‰!

<<<<<<< HEAD
## Creating your Nolu dashboard and views
=======
!IMPORTANT NOTE!
As you might have noticed we have suffixed the default nolu custom parts with `_example`. The example-parts are:

- `configuration_example.yaml` - contains the basic configuration
- `nolu/custom_example/` - this folder contains the basic custom files

You might want to proceed renaming the `configuration_example.yaml` to `configuration.yaml` and the `nolu/custom_example/`-folder to `nolu/custom/`. Don't forget to update the references to `nolu/custom_example/`-folder. By default there is a reference in the `configuration_example.yaml`.

## The Nolu concept

In the `configuration.yaml` you will see that I've split the framework in two parts. The `core`-part and the `custom`-part. The `core`-part should not be edited, as it may have consequences that are irreversible for the proper working of the theme. The `custom`-part however is free for the user to edit and play around with. I've left a basic custom directory structure intact for reference.

### The `custom` directory

By default this is called `custom_example`. We assume you renamed it to `nolu/custom/` after the installation. At the root of the `custom`-directory (`nolu/custom`) you will find the `custom.config.yaml`. This file basically contains your views definition. So this file contains the different 'pages' for your setup. Under every page you can define your entities and some extra options that are made available. More on that later (TBD).

`custom/package` - contains files that are read by the root `configuration.yaml` for the custom package. Define automations, configuration, input booleans, light groups, persons sensors etc. here.

`custom/includes` - the includes folder contains all directories/files that are in anyway included by `package` or other files. I've use the following structure:

- `includes/automations` - contains all automations (seperate directories)
- `includes/config` - contains all setup files used for integrations and others inside the `configuration.yaml`
- `includes/sensors` - contains sub directory `integration_sensors` and `template_sensors` which hold the those specific sensors
- `includes/templats` - usefull or repeately used jinja templates

#### Creating a custom dashboard

Open `nolu/custom_example/custom.config.yaml`. Creating a view is very simple. This can be done by typing in the lowercase name. The name cannot contain any spaces, use an underscore instead. Below contains more information and a typical example of a configuration.
>>>>>>> develop

1. Open `nolu/custom/custom.config.yaml`
2. Creating views is very simple. This can be done by typing in the lowercase name. The name cannot contain any spaces, use an underscore instead. Below contains more information and a typical example of an example view called `example_home`:
```yaml
# custom.config.yaml

example_home:
  name: 'Example Home'
  title: 'mdi:home-assistant'
  url: 'home'
  show_in_navbar: true
  show_header: true
  # `rows` - list that can contain multiple single rows
  rows:
    # `rows item` - a single row containing its elements (which are mostly what Home Assistant calls cards)
    - widgets:
        # To be defined (TODO:)...
```

## Creating the Badge counters

1. Open `nolu/custom/includes/config/groups/entity_counters.group.yaml` and define the entity groups. You can also create custom ones yourself, but start with the predefined stuff. Let's add some light-entities to `all_light_entities`.
2. After placing your entities under the designated groups open `nolu/custom/includes/sensors/template_sensors/sensors/entity_counters.sensor.yaml`. This file contains all the counting logic for the groups you've just added the entities to. If you found the sensor for the group you want to use copy the sensor name to your clipboard. For our example the sensor is called `current_lights_on`. As you can see in the code the `value_template` uses the `group.all_light_entities`. Since it is a custom sensor the full reference is `sensor.current_lights_on`.
3. Open the `nolu/custom/custom.config.yaml` and add the `badge_entities`-key and the `sensor.current_lights_on`-value to your view like so:
```yaml
# custom.config.yaml

...
example_lights:
  name: 'Example Lights'
  title: 'mdi:light-bulb'
  url: 'lights'
  show_in_navbar: true
  show_header: true
  badge_entities: sensor.current_lights_on # The `badge_entities` key should do the trick ;-)
  rows:
    - widgets:
...
```
4. Restart Home Assistant
5. After rebooting you should see the badge counters show up IF a light that is part of the `all_light_entities` is turned on

## The Nolu concept

In the `configuration.yaml` you will see that I've split the framework in two parts. The `core`-part and the `custom`-part. The `core`-part should not be edited, as it may have consequences that are irreversible for the proper working of the theme. The `custom`-part however is free for the user to edit and play around with. I've left a basic custom directory structure intact for reference.

### The `custom` directory

At the root of the `custom`-directory (`nolu/custom`) you will find the `custom.config.yaml`. This file basically contains your views definition. So this file contains the different 'pages' for your setup. Under every page you can define your entities and some extra options that are made available. More on that later (TBD).

`custom/package` - contains files that are read by the root `configuration.yaml` for the custom package. Define automations, configuration, input booleans, light groups, persons sensors etc. here.

`custom/includes` - the includes folder contains all directories/files that are in anyway included by `package` or other files. I've use the following structure:

- `includes/automations` - contains all automations (seperate directories)
- `includes/config` - contains all setup files used for integrations and others inside the `configuration.yaml`
- `includes/sensors` - contains sub directory `integration_sensors` and `template_sensors` which hold the those specific sensors
- `includes/templates` - usefull or repeately used jinja templates 

#### Badge Counters

Badge counters are a combination between custom grouped entities and custom entity sensors. The definition of the custom grouped entities can be found in `nolu/custom_example/includes/config/groups/entity_counters.group.yaml`. Besides the custom grouped entities Nolu uses custom entity sensors that calculate the amount of active entities. The definition of the custom entity sensors can be found in `nolu/custom_example/includes/sensors/template_sensors/sensors/entity_counters.sensor.yaml`.

The `entity_counters.group.yaml` contains a few predefined groups. A group starts with the name of the group (e.g. `all_climate_entities`). The group name is always followed by the `entities`-list in this list you define the entities that are part of that group.

### The `core` directory

[To be defined (TODO:)]

#### `llg` files

The `llg`-files are an important part of the Nolu framework. These files are all `lovelace_gen`-types. This means that they contain Jinja code. They are, however, `yaml`-files. The Jinja code makes these files so much easier to work with and reduce the code we write for the framework. In short, the `nolu/custom/custom.config.yaml` which holds the simple interface yaml gets interpreted by `nolu/core/includes/views/core_view.llg.yaml`.

There are three main reasons for suffixing these files with `*.llg.yaml`:
1. A developer or editor working on this framework immediately identifies a `lovelace_gen`-file
2. It is a good reminder to any developer or editor to put the `# lovelace_gen` comment on top of this file (see the [lovelace_gen documentation](https://github.com/thomasloven/hass-lovelace_gen#second-of-all))
3. I use the ['Better Jinja'-extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=samuelcolvin.jinjahtml) in VScode. This lets VScode know that the `yaml` file used can contain `Jinja` code. In the settings of VScode I've set the better jinja extension only to look at `*.llg.yaml`. Out of the box you get a lot of errors in VScode because it doesn't understand the mixture between `Jinja` and `yaml`. You can check the recommended plugins in VScode for this project in the `.vscode/extensions.json` and the VScode settings in `.vscode/settings.json`.

## FAQ

- Q: HACS is disabled due to ratelimited error
  - A: You can try and open the `.storage` -directory of your Hass server and remove the `HACS`-folder. This worked for us. If that doesn't help you could [check](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/github-rate-limit-error-hacs/229709) or it might mean you'll have to wait an hour for the limit to pass ðŸ˜­ (see [this post](https://hacs.xyz/docs/faq/initial_startup/] for more info) for more info)
- Q:  `Check Configuration` results in errors referring to browser_mod or lovelace_gen not found
  - A: Open `configuration.yaml` in your file editor and comment out the `packages` and `customize` parts of the configuration (so also the indented lines underneath them until, but not included, the `default_config:` line)

## Specials thanks, shoutouts and credits

I want to thank two people for inspiring me to create this theme/framework and without their awesome projects this wouldn't be possible.

#         BUNDLED SENSORS - !DON'T EDIT THIS FILE!
#
# This directory contains both the sensors created by native integrations
# AND the custom template sensors.
#
# The native integration sensors are the ones
# that are added by the integration platform.
# Place your custom sensors in the template_sensors folder, like so:
# `nolu/custom_example/includes/sensors/bundled_sensors/integration_sensors/integration_name.sensor.yaml`
#
# The custom template sensors are created by the user and can contain anything they like.
# Place your custom sensors in the template_sensors folder, like so:
# `nolu/custom_example/includes/sensors/bundled_sensors/template_sensors/my_sensor.sensor.yaml`
